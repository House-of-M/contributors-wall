An initiative by the **House of M** to help open source project contributors get a quick shutout on a public wall!

This small project is in the first place dedicated to those who contribute to the organization's public projects, but it's also open for those who contribute to any open source project outside the organization.

## How it works
Contributors can setup their cards on the live website and share links and resources about usefull projects they are proud of, they are working on or they contributed to!
- It helps other contributors catch on interesting projects.
- It's meant to include more features for a wider audience shoutout/reach.
- It presents links & quick info about interesting projects you can work on.

## Regarding Hacktoberfest

The repo is intended to be an active project for all times and it will take part in different events when possible such as Hacktoberfest!

The **Contributors Wall** is surely a good and welcoming initiative for all open source contributors to have their name on the contributors wall and acts as a simple way to introduce new comers to the open source world and the contributing workflow.
